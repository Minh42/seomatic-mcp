# Indexing check

A page Google does not index cannot rank, so this is the first thing to rule
out. Use Search Console's own URL Inspection data, not a guess from a crawl.

## Prerequisite

Search Console must be connected. If a tool reports it is not, give the user
this link and stop: https://app.seomatic.ai/connect/gsc - it is one browser
step, then re-ask. Do not substitute guesses for GSC data.

## 1. Choose what to inspect

If the user named URLs, inspect those. Otherwise build the list from what
matters: `site_pages` action `inventory` for the site's real pages, and
`gsc_performance` action `top_pages` for the ones earning clicks. Money pages
and recently published pages first.

## 2. Inspect

`gsc_indexing` action `inspect` for one URL with full diagnostics, or
`batch_inspect` for many. For each page read: coverage state, last crawl,
Google-selected canonical against the declared one, robots and noindex, and
mobile usability where present.

## 3. Translate each status

| Status | What it means | Usual fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Crawled - currently not indexed | Google read it and decided it is not worth indexing | Make it more useful or distinct (`content_refresh`), link to it (`internal_links`) |
| Discovered - currently not indexed | Google knows the URL but has not crawled it | Internal links, sitemap, request indexing (`index_request`) |
| Duplicate, Google chose different canonical | Google indexes another URL instead | Fix the canonical (`canonical`) or consolidate |
| Excluded by noindex | The page tells Google not to index it | Remove noindex if unintended (`robots_directives`) |
| Blocked by robots.txt | Google may not crawl it | Fix robots.txt (`robots_txt`) |
| Page with redirect / 404 | Not a real page | Fix the internal links pointing at it (`broken_link_fix`) |

Some exclusions are correct (tag archives, cart pages, staging URLs). Say so.

## 4. Check the sitemaps

`gsc_insights` action `sitemaps`: submitted, errors, and how many URLs are
indexed against submitted. A sitemap full of redirects or noindexed URLs
wastes crawl. If there is no sitemap submitted, `sitemap_submit` fixes it.

For a site-wide view, the `site_audit` tool crawls up to 30 pages and catches
noindex leaks and canonical mismatches across templates.

## 5. Report

One line per page: URL, status in plain words, why, the fix. Then the count:
"14 of 20 key pages indexed; 4 are crawled but not indexed, 2 point their
canonical at the homepage."

## Offer to stage the work

Staging needs a paid SEOmatic plan (the key carries the `agents:act` scope).
It costs no credits, runs nothing, and always waits for the user's approval.
On a free key the staging actions are locked and say which plan includes
them: describe the specific fix instead so the user can pass it on.

Check `task_manage` action `list` first so you do not stage a duplicate.
Then `task_manage` action `create` with up to 5 tasks: `index_request`, `canonical`, `robots_directives`, `robots_txt`, `sitemap_submit`, `internal_links` or `content_refresh` as the status calls for. `noindex` and `redirect` are destructive and need `confirmDestructive: true` after the user signs off on that URL. Each task
needs `targetKey` (the full page URL, or a topic for content work), a
`title` that states the goal in the user's words ("Get 'pricing calculator'
onto page 1", never "Optimize meta tags"), and a `rationale` with the
numbers behind it. Quote cost from each task's `estimatedCost.label`.

- Tell the user the cards are staged and where to approve them.
- Never approve on the user's behalf. Approval happens in SEOmatic, or
  through `task_manage` action `decide` only after the user says yes to that
  specific task.
- Approved auto-executable tasks start within seconds: read the result back
  with `task_manage` action `get` before you claim anything changed.

## What not to do

- Do not promise a page will be indexed by a date. Requesting indexing asks
  Google; it does not force it.
- Do not request indexing for a page that is excluded for a good reason.
