# Keyword cannibalization

Two pages splitting one query usually means neither ranks as well as one
would. But most "cannibalization" reports are noise: a homepage and a product
page both showing for the brand name is normal. This skill finds the cases
that actually cost clicks.

## Prerequisite

Search Console must be connected. If a tool reports it is not, give the user
this link and stop: https://app.seomatic.ai/connect/gsc - it is one browser
step, then re-ask. Do not substitute guesses for GSC data.

## 1. Pull the real conflicts

`gsc_insights` action `cannibalization` (28 days, `minImpressions` 50).
It returns queries where several of the site's pages earn impressions. Then
`gsc_performance` action `query_pages` on the top candidates to see each
page's own clicks, impressions and position for that query.

## 2. Keep only the ones that cost something

A conflict matters when:

- Two pages both sit in positions 5-30 for the query, and neither is
  clearly winning, or
- The ranking URL flips between pages week to week (`gsc_performance` action
  `dimension_breakdown` with `dimension` date and `filterQuery`), or
- The page Google prefers is the wrong one (a blog post outranking the money
  page for a buying query).

Drop brand queries and cases where one page has over 80% of the clicks. Those
are already resolved.

## 3. Pick the winner and the fix

`site_pages` action `crawl` both pages. Then choose one of four fixes:

| Situation | Fix | Task type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Same intent, one page clearly stronger | Merge the weaker into the stronger | `consolidate` |
| Different intents, wrong page ranking | Retarget the weaker away from the query | `cannib_retarget` (needs `queries`) |
| Weaker page has no value of its own | 301 it to the winner | `redirect` |
| Both deserve to exist | Clarify with internal links pointing at the winner | `internal_links` |

`redirect` removes a URL from the index. It needs the user's explicit
sign-off on that specific URL, and `task_manage` action `decide` requires
`confirmDestructive: true` for it. Never set that on your own judgment.

## 4. Present it

For each conflict: the query, both pages with their own numbers, which page
should win and why, and the fix. Five real conflicts beat fifty rows.

## Offer to stage the work

Staging needs a paid SEOmatic plan (the key carries the `agents:act` scope).
It costs no credits, runs nothing, and always waits for the user's approval.
On a free key the staging actions are locked and say which plan includes
them: describe the specific fix instead so the user can pass it on.

Check `task_manage` action `list` first so you do not stage a duplicate.
Then `task_manage` action `create` with up to 5 tasks: `consolidate`, `cannib_retarget` (with `queries`), `redirect`, or `internal_links` as chosen above. Each task
needs `targetKey` (the full page URL, or a topic for content work), a
`title` that states the goal in the user's words ("Get 'pricing calculator'
onto page 1", never "Optimize meta tags"), and a `rationale` with the
numbers behind it. Quote cost from each task's `estimatedCost.label`.

- Tell the user the cards are staged and where to approve them.
- Never approve on the user's behalf. Approval happens in SEOmatic, or
  through `task_manage` action `decide` only after the user says yes to that
  specific task.
- Approved auto-executable tasks start within seconds: read the result back
  with `task_manage` action `get` before you claim anything changed.

## What not to do

- Do not redirect anything without the user naming that URL and agreeing.
- Do not report brand-query overlap as a problem.
- Do not pick the winner by URL shape. Pick it by intent and its own numbers.
