# Keyword research

Generic keyword research starts from a seed and ends with a spreadsheet of
terms the site has no chance at. This skill starts from what Google already
thinks the site is about, and ends with keywords mapped to pages.

## 1. Start from evidence

- `get_target_terms`: the searches the business has said bring it customers,
  each with the page that should show. If they exist, they are the anchor.
- `gsc_performance` action `top_queries` (90 days, high limit): what the
  site already shows for, including queries with impressions but no clicks.
  Those are the cheapest keywords on the list.
- `keyword_clusters` action `list`: clusters SEOmatic has already built for
  this site.

If Search Console is not connected, say the research will be weaker and ask
for 3-5 seed terms and the business's main offer.

## 2. Expand

`keyword_research` action `suggestions` from the strongest 3-5 seeds, then
`metrics` on the shortlist: volume, difficulty, CPC, intent. `trend`,
`compare_trends` and `related` (free, Google Trends) for direction: a
keyword halving year on year is a bad bet.

## 3. Check the SERP before committing

`serp_competitors` action `features` on the top candidates. A keyword
whose results are all marketplaces, or answered fully in an AI overview, is
worth less than its volume says. CPC is a better guide to commercial value
than volume.

## 4. Cluster and map

Group by intent: one page per intent, not one page per keyword. Then map
each cluster to a page: an existing one (`site_pages` action `inventory`)
or a new one. Two clusters mapped to the same page, or one cluster spread over
three pages, is a problem to flag.

| Cluster | Main keyword | Volume | Difficulty | Intent | Page (existing / new) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 5. Recommend an order

1. Keywords the site already shows for at positions 8-20 (fastest).
2. High-intent clusters with an existing page that under-covers them.
3. New pages for clusters the site can credibly own.

## Offer to stage the work

Staging needs a paid SEOmatic plan (the key carries the `agents:act` scope).
It costs no credits, runs nothing, and always waits for the user's approval.
On a free key the staging actions are locked and say which plan includes
them: describe the specific fix instead so the user can pass it on.

Check `task_manage` action `list` first so you do not stage a duplicate.
Then `task_manage` action `create` with up to 5 tasks: `striking_distance` (with `queries`) for group 1, `content_refresh` for group 2, `content_create` (targetKey = the topic) for group 3. Each task
needs `targetKey` (the full page URL, or a topic for content work), a
`title` that states the goal in the user's words ("Get 'pricing calculator'
onto page 1", never "Optimize meta tags"), and a `rationale` with the
numbers behind it. Quote cost from each task's `estimatedCost.label`.

- Tell the user the cards are staged and where to approve them.
- Never approve on the user's behalf. Approval happens in SEOmatic, or
  through `task_manage` action `decide` only after the user says yes to that
  specific task.
- Approved auto-executable tasks start within seconds: read the result back
  with `task_manage` action `get` before you claim anything changed.

## What not to do

- Do not present a 500-row keyword list. The value is the selection.
- Do not invent volumes or difficulty. Quote the tool's numbers.
- Do not recommend keywords outside what the business actually sells.
