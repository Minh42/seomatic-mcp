# AI crawler check

An AI assistant can only cite a page it can fetch. This skill checks which AI
bots reach the site, what they read, and where the chain from crawl to
citation breaks.

## 1. Who visits

`get_ai_crawler_activity`: AI bots that visited, classified by purpose:

- **Answer-time retrieval** (ChatGPT-User, Perplexity-User and similar): a
  real person asked an assistant a question and it fetched your page live.
  This is the one closest to a customer.
- **AI-search indexing** (OAI-SearchBot, PerplexityBot): building the index
  assistants search.
- **Model training** (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, Google-Extended, CCBot): feeding
  future models. Blocking these is a legitimate business choice and does not
  remove the site from AI search.

If there is no crawler data, the site's logs are not connected. Say so and
point to https://app.seomatic.ai/dashboard/integrations.

## 2. Is anything blocked by mistake

`site_pages` action `crawl` on the homepage and a key page, and read
robots.txt. Common mistakes:

- A blanket "block all AI" rule copied from a blog post that also blocks the
  search and retrieval bots, removing the site from ChatGPT search.
- A CDN or firewall bot rule that returns 403 to AI user agents.
- Key content rendered only in JavaScript, which most AI fetchers do not run.

The `site_audit` tool flags noindex leaks and canonical problems that hurt
AI search the same way they hurt Google.

## 3. Crawl to citation

`get_ai_funnel`: per page, cited (engines named it as a source), crawled
(bots fetched it), referred (GA4-measured visits from assistants). Read the
gaps:

- Crawled, never cited: the page is reachable but not the best answer.
- Cited, never crawled recently: the citation is from an old copy.
- Never crawled: check links, sitemap and blocks.

`ai_citations` action `observed_citations` shows the real answers that cited
the site.

## 4. Report

Which bots reach the site and which are blocked (on purpose or not), the top
pages AI reads, and the 3 fixes with the biggest effect.

## Offer to stage the work

Staging needs a paid SEOmatic plan (the key carries the `agents:act` scope).
It costs no credits, runs nothing, and always waits for the user's approval.
On a free key the staging actions are locked and say which plan includes
them: describe the specific fix instead so the user can pass it on.

Check `task_manage` action `list` first so you do not stage a duplicate.
Then `task_manage` action `create` with up to 5 tasks: `robots_txt` for a wrong block, `geo_enrichment` for crawled-but-never-cited pages, `technical_fix` for rendering problems. Each task
needs `targetKey` (the full page URL, or a topic for content work), a
`title` that states the goal in the user's words ("Get 'pricing calculator'
onto page 1", never "Optimize meta tags"), and a `rationale` with the
numbers behind it. Quote cost from each task's `estimatedCost.label`.

- Tell the user the cards are staged and where to approve them.
- Never approve on the user's behalf. Approval happens in SEOmatic, or
  through `task_manage` action `decide` only after the user says yes to that
  specific task.
- Approved auto-executable tasks start within seconds: read the result back
  with `task_manage` action `get` before you claim anything changed.

## What not to do

- Do not tell the user llms.txt is required. No major engine has said it
  uses it; it is cheap to add, not a fix.
- Do not recommend blocking or allowing training bots as a ranking tactic.
  It is a licensing choice; present it as one.
