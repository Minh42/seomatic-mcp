# Client SEO report

A report a client reads in two minutes and trusts. Outcome first, then the
work, then the plan. Every number comes from a tool, with its date range.

## Prerequisite

Search Console must be connected. If a tool reports it is not, give the user
this link and stop: https://app.seomatic.ai/connect/gsc - it is one browser
step, then re-ask. Do not substitute guesses for GSC data.

If the user manages several sites, the tools are scoped to one workspace at a
time. Confirm which site this report is for before starting.

## 1. The headline numbers

`gsc_performance` action `compare_periods` (the month against the month
before; use 28 days if the user did not name dates). Clicks, impressions,
average CTR, average position. Then `gsc_insights` action `seasonality`: if
the change matches last year's pattern, the report says so. A client who sees
a seasonal dip explained trusts the next good month.

`gsc_insights` action `brand_split`: non-brand clicks are the number SEO
actually moves. Report it separately.

If GA4 is connected, `traffic_analytics` action `overview` and `sources`
for sessions, and `landing_pages` for where organic visitors arrive.

## 2. What we did, and did it work

`task_manage` action `list` with status `verified`, then `ineffective`,
`regressed` and `inconclusive`, and `in_progress` / `verifying` for work
still maturing. For each finished change: what changed, on which page, and
the measured result from the task's evidence. Report the ones that did not
work too. An agency report that only lists wins is not believed.

## 3. AI search

`get_ai_visibility`: brand visibility per engine (ChatGPT, Claude, Google AI
Overviews and any others tracked) against the previous scan. `ai_citations`
action `observed_citations` for real answers that cited the site. Skip the
section if no scan exists; do not fill it with guesses.

## 4. Next month

`strategy_insights` action `strategy` for the ranked big plays, and
`task_manage` action `list` with status `proposed` for work waiting on
approval. Three priorities, each with the reason in one line.

## Format

```
[Site] SEO report, [exact dates]

Summary: [one sentence, the outcome]

Results       This month   Last month   Change
Clicks        ...
Non-brand     ...
Impressions   ...
Avg position  ...

What we changed (N)
- [page]: [change] -> [measured result or "still measuring until <date>"]

AI search
- [engine]: [visibility] ([change])

Next month
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

Waiting on you: [N] changes to approve at [link]
```

Plain words. No "synergies", no "leveraging", no unexplained acronyms.

## What not to do

- Do not take credit for a change the data does not attribute to the work.
- Do not hide a bad month. Explain it.
- Do not round in the flattering direction.
